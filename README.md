# Normalisation training

1. Create a table.csv listing all texts and their metadata.
One column must include the file name of each text : e.g., CRRPV16_Chansons_nouvelles.tsv

3. Create the corpus including all processed texts.
Every processed text is in a tsv file including two columns for each line of text, one column for original lines and one for normalised lines.

4. Create the split with one or more scripts.
